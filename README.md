# 1StBuild-5-Projects-with-HTML-CSS-and-Javascript

The first Project in this youtube video was craating a blurry loading screen
Something I learned from this was the scale function that helped create the loading effect
Another Key thing I learned was using style on JavaScript and how to manipulate different
CSS styles. For example this line below using "" was necessary because you needed
to change the text from blur. You could not just use a number to change it, as well as the
px at the end of it. it is basically CSS code but with a different number
bg.style.filter = `blur(${scale(load, 0, 100, 30, 0)}px)`

Using setInterval was something I should practice more and get use to but that was another thing 
that I had to recall and moving forward I would like to practice more of.
